Hell Tomato is a platforming enemy wave game made by me and my classmates for our college semester project.

# History
Foma, a young farmer, daughter of a hero and a peasant, inherited her mother's huge farm and soon made it the largest farm in the country. Focusing mainly on crops, Foma lived peacefully in the middle of her land.

While planting her fruit, Foma sees a huge bolt of lightning coming from the northernmost exiled part of her plantation. Worried about her crops, Foma checks what happened, and discovers that a Demon Lord has taken her land by force. So, she decides to take revenge on the Demon Lord.

Foma, taking her best clothes and disguised herself in the demon territory, and with a magic book, she begins to set fire to the entire place.
